# SCENIC protocol -- https://scenic.aertslab.org/

## TODO
1. single format script or notebook to generate all the files necessary for all the tools? is that too mcuh
2. in preprocess.ipynb, get the data ready for SCENIC specifically
3. in run.ipynb, illustrate how to set up script running
3. in eval.ipynb, evaluate those results for a set of criteria

## Workflow

### Download data from Synapse and Google Drive (coming soon)

### Run the steps in the `../format.ipynb` notebook to create inputs to preprocess

### Run the steps in the `preprocess.ipynb` notebook to create filtered loom files for SCENIC run

### Run the steps in the `run.ipynb` notebook to run different configurations of SCENIC pipleine

### Run the steps in the `eval.ipynb` notebook to run different analyses on the SCENIC output
